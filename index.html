        <p>Phantom Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet that allows its users to access decentralized apps available on the Solana network. This digital wallet of the Solana blockchain helps you to trade cryptocurrency and even manage your digital assets.</p>
        <p>When the&nbsp;<span style="color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://phantom.app/">Phantom wallet</a></span>&nbsp;was launched, it was available only as a browser extension in its initial days. But after some time, the company launched an app for iPhone users. You can use this app of Phantom wallet to directly access all its services without any desktop. For this, download and install the Solana Phantom wallet on your iPhone from its website, i.e., https://phantom.app/. Once the app is installed on your device, you can easily deposit, transfer, stake, and swap assets on Solana using it. The wallet also generates and manages private keys where you can store your SOL and sign transactions.</p>

        <p>First of all, you need some funds to start using the wallet. You have to send SOL, i.e., the native asset of the Solana blockchain before sending Solana (SPL) tokens to your Phantom wallet. This is done because you need some SOL for paying the transaction fees to perform any transactions on the Solana blockchain. This is just like ETH which is used as a gas fee on Ethereum and BNB as a gas fee on the Binance Smart Chain network.</p>
        <h3><strong>Install Phantom</strong></h3>
        <p>You have to install the Phantom app for your Chrome browser using its website, i.e., https://phantom.app/. Click on the Download button located at the top-right corner and select your browser from the list of supported browsers appearing on the homepage.</p>

        <p>You will get the receiving address and the QR code to receive the asset on the screen of the application.</p>
        <h3><strong>Send</strong></h3>
        <p>The Send option allows you to transfer your tokens to other wallet users. To Send the token from your wallet, you have to enter the recipient wallet address and the number of tokens. After entering the asked information, confirm the process.</p>
